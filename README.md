# Awesome Nextjs[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) <!-- omit in toc -->

I have compiled a list of NPM libraries that can be used to develop small and large-scale applications with Next.js. The list is based on my experience as a front-end developer, and I have used 80% of the packages mentioned.

As I discover more packages in the future, I will add them to the current list to help other front-end developers build applications with Next.js more efficiently.

To stay updated, follow us on GitHub and give our repository a star. This will help others discover our repository, encouraging more developers to contribute and build a solid list. Additionally, we encourage you to share our repository on your social media platforms, like X (previously known as Twitter).

> You can share your favorite library, tool, or template related to next.js. It helps full for other developers. Before sharing your favorite library, tool, or template, please read our [Contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
